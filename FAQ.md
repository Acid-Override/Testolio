## Introduction
### 1.1 What is Ubuntu Touch? (What is it to someone who doesn't know what Ubuntu is?)

Ubuntu Touch is the touch-friendly mobile version of the popular Ubuntu operating system. Originally designed and developed by Canonical Ltd, the project now resides with the UBports Foundation.  

The Ubuntu operating system, upon which Ubuntu Touch is based, is one of the most popular Linux distributions in the world. UBports is the new home for Ubuntu Touch and will continue with Canonical's original mission of Convergence — the bold idea of bringing mobile computing to the desktop and desktop computing to mobile which will now be developed by the UBports Foundation.

The goal of Convergence will be to seamlessly blend mobile and desktop environments into a single unified experience. UBports Foundation is excited to continue development of Ubuntu Touch and to bring Convergence to life.

### 1.2 Who is developing Ubuntu Touch?
    
An amazing team of coders, developers, testers and users from around the world working together to successfully advance the Ubuntu Touch project. Officially, the UBports Foundation will be the legal entity encompassing the project, but it is the community of volunteers that make Ubuntu Touch what it is today. If it were not for this community of dedicated individuals who've spent countless hours, and many sleepless nights, working on the project, we would not have the dream of Convergence and the Ubuntu Touch experience that everyone knows and loves.

### 1.3 What sets Ubuntu Touch apart from Apple and Android?
    
Ubuntu Touch has something no other mobile device has. Convergence — One platform for phone, tablet, desktop/laptop, TV and server. Users will experience the freedom of chosing any device they desire by having a unified operatin system. Application developers create programs once, and they are automatically adjusted for optimal use dependent on the user and device. Desktop apps can run on the phone, and phone apps can run on the desktop... with only one app! The possibilities are exiciting and the future of computing is Convergence!

### 1.4 What is UBports?

UBports is the foundation/legal entity that stands behind projects like Ubuntu Touch. The UBports project was founded by Marius Gripsgard in 2015 and the programming source code for the project was, thanks to the hard work of many volunteers, picked up and moved into the free software community where the project could not only be maintained but also expanded. 

### 1.5 What is the UBports Foundation?

We are happy to say that we've collected the required members to file the paperwork to raise the UBports Foundation. This is an important step forward in the process. Our goal is still to have the Foundation ready for the beginning of next year.

The UBports Foundation's mission is to support the collaborative development of Ubuntu Touch and to promote the widespread use of Ubuntu Touch. It will give users a body to trust in the development of Ubuntu Touch. It will also improve our transparency in funding, spending, and decision making.

To learn more about the UBports Foundation, please visit https://www.ubports.com/page/foundation


Our goals:

- Help and promote the collaborative software development of Ubuntu Touch; 

- Encourage the development of Ubuntu Touch and its features while coordinating and organizing the collaborative work on the software; 

- Assist the community while defending its interests and the sustainability of its developments; 

- Promote the use of the Ubuntu Touch as solution for mobile devices; 

- Facilitate synergies, collaborations and fund raising efforts; 

- Actively collaborate on the definition of the roadmaps of new versions, features and their implementation.


## 16.04 ... Here we come!!

### 2.1 Why won't all Canonical devices get an upgrade to the new 16.04 base?      
          
The simple answer is that we cannot upgrade these devices because their Android source tree is closed and there is no *official* Lineage OS port available. This can be broken down into *more* explanation!

a) Why do you need Android at all? Aren't you making a GNU/Linux distribution?    

This is the unfortunate reality of Android hardware. There is no BIOS or UEFI to start up all the bits and pieces of a device. There aren't standard ways to access hardware. To be perfectly honest, it's a complete mess. It's the mess that we live in, though. 

Android drivers are written for Android and nothing else. A regular GNU/Linux distro has no way to use these drivers as they speak completely different languages. Because of this, we need to run a small copy of Android to translate between Android drivers and the language that GNU/Linux speaks. This is provided by Halium.

In order to build Halium for a single device, we need to have all of the source and configuration that goes into that device. This brings up our next problem.

Closed Android Source Tree                                      

Most of Android is licensed under the Apache license, so there is no need for a device manufacturer to provide this code and configuration to the world. BQ and Meizu chose not to provide this source code except to their partners. This choice is within their rights.


"But wait," we hear you say. "Here's a GitHub link to the kernel source of *device X*. Now you can port to it!"

A device kernel must always be open source due to the copyleft nature of the GPL. That's not all of Android, though. There's another ~20GB of source code that gets compiled into our hardware compatibility layer.

Sometimes, though, the Lineage OS community is able to put everything together and release their OS to a closed source device. This can lead to our third problem.


Official Lineage OS Ports                                      

For now, official ports of Halium are based on official ports of Lineage OS. This is because we want to provide the most reliable experience for developers. An unofficial port of Lineage OS (or Resurrection Remix, or one of the other hundreds of Android ROMs) can have issues in drivers that cripple development before it even begins. We don't have the time or manpower to deal with these issues. Porting to devices is difficult enough as it is.


Of course, we will always accept community help getting moforre devices ported. The Nexus 4 port is community-maintained, for example. We simply will not take that work on ourselves right now.

We hope this better explains our position on the official Canonical devices.



### 2.2 Why not skip 16.04 and go directly to 18.04?

An excellent question. Going from 15.04 to 16.04 isn't easy, but it seems to be much easier than going from 15.04 to the (very early) 18.04. Similarly, rebuilding 15.04 sources on a 16.04 base isn't easy, but it is faster. Choosing the easier path means a faster release, which means we don't get left in the dust. Release early, release often.


### 2.3 What is the most recent version?

The most stable version available for the core devices (Nexus5, Fairphone 2 and Oneplus One) is 15.04. Soon 16.04 LTS will be released for these devices. The next version, 16.04 LTS, is under active heavy development and will be released shortly. For developers and testers interested in working on 16.04, please check out the wiki at https://wiki.ubports.com/wiki/How-to-install-Ubuntu-Touch-16.04


### 2.4 Which devices will be supported by the 16.04 branch? Update

The core devices... please see

   This is not yet decided

   Promising candidates are the Fairphone 2, Nexus 5, Oneplus One and Bq M10 tablet, but this may change in the future.

   [is this still updated? i think this might have some more certainty] (Actually, it's even more difficult to explain. I've been told not to go into detail as Sudoku is early days.)


### 2.5 When will I be able to re-flash my phone with new 16.04 images?

We're working as fast as we can to get the images out there but currently do not have fixed dates. The Halium project is expected to signifcantly speed this process up.

   (You can right now, but we don't really want to provide instructions since very little works on 16.04)


With the success of Halium, our release time frame is expected to be significantly reduced and we will be able to push out new images much quicker. The Halium project will unify the Hardware Abstraction Layer and create a bridge between Android hardware and the Ubuntu Touch operating system. With a successful Halium project, UBports team will spend less time on Android device drivers and more time on Ubuntu Touch. That is what we like to call a Win–Win.
