# Road Map and Organization for UBports

- Convergence and Translation are part of Product in my view
- Helpful to separate communication with the community from communication with other. Communication and Marketing are not distinct enough
- Donations and Patreon are on opposite sides of the map
- Community, Infrastructure and Business Development are for me the main headings. Governance is a separate, smaller bubble that can be fitted alongside any one of those
- Community and Business Development are getting tangled up here. Promotion/Marketing should be with Business Development
- Product either belongs in Business Development or there is a separate thing, Engineering
- Actually, Engineering into Infrastructure and Governance into Business Development
- Balance and the avoidance of over-reach argue against any one group taking on too much of the whole
